# Ecolight_Maestro
EcoLight Maestro Focuses on Smart Control of LED Streetlights, Ensuring they Operate Automatically using Preset Time Slots and Real-Time Ambient Light Detection.
## Project Overview  
EcoLight Maestro is a smart energy management system designed on **ARM7TDMI-S (LPC2148)** microcontroller.  
The project automatically controls lights based on environmental conditions, optimizing energy usage and reducing wastage.  
It demonstrates the real-time working of embedded systems for **sustainable smart living**.  

## Features  
â€¢	Automatic switching of lights based on ambient light.  
â€¢	Real-Time Clock (RTC) integration for scheduled control.  
â€¢	Energy-efficient design using ARM7-based microcontroller.  
â€¢	LCD Display for system status & monitoring.  
â€¢	User-friendly configuration and easy expandability.

## System Workflow

- Startup â†’ Initialize LCD, RTC, ADC, LEDs, Relay.
- RTC Check â†’ If current time matches schedule â†’ Light ON.
- Else â†’ LDR sensor checks brightness â†’
     - Dark â†’ Light ON
     - Bright â†’ Light OFF
- LCD Display â†’ Shows RTC time + Light status(ON/OFF).
- User Mode â†’ Press switch â†’ directly update RTC / modify schedules.
